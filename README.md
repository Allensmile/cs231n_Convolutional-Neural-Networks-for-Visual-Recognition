My own code of cs231n: convolutional net for computer vision.The course website: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/
Here are my solutions for this above course (Winter 2016), for the benefit of people who struggle greatly to solve them (like myself). 
I myself (and some of my coursemates) did not enrolled in Stanford to take this course;
I just have generous access to the course notes, lecture videos and assignment code, which is made public for everyone. 
Therefore I do not guarantee that my solutions are correct, so if you spot any errors do let me know.

As of this writing I have completed the course material
